# Predicting model of the steering angle project

This realization is part of my self-driving car project, and represents implementations of AI algoritms for predicting steering angle of wheels, in
depending on curvature of the roal lines

My implementation inspired from following  [Nvidia article](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf)

Obtained results proving the efficiency of suggested model architecture for this sort of problem-solving.
